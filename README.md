🐾 Mouse’s Enchanted Adventures 🐾

A whimsical children’s world starring Mouse the vampire cat, Bat the fearless familiar, and their witch and warlock friends Katherina and Devlin. Bright, cozy, and a little spooky in the fun way.

Quick pitch: magic, mischief, and a very dapper cat in a red bowtie.
